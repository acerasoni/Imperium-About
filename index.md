## Introduction 

Imperium is a subscription management platform. It has been developed for my Undergraduate Dissertation project during 2019/20 at the University of Nottingham. 

The system allows customers to subscribe to online services and control their subscription status (including suspension and deletion) directly from the Android application. 

The solution integrates seamlessly into eCommerce websites, and provides merchants with a payment portal through which they can bill their customers. The foremost focus of this project has been security of cardholder data, therefore this system implements payment tokenization and encrypts all data on the customer's device. 

## Android

The Android application can be used to manage subscriptions and generate Sync Codes, which can be entered on a merchant's website during the subscription process.
